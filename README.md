# Code Learning Hub

This demo page shows "Hello World" examples for various programming languages. Use the language selector to view code samples. Click the translate button to toggle between English and Thai interface text.

To add more languages, edit `samples.js` and include a new entry in the exported `samples` object.

This repository is a minimal demonstration and not a full learning system for every language in existence.
