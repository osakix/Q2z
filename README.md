# Code Learning Hub

This project demonstrates a small code-learning web page powered by [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/). It displays "Hello World" examples for many programming languages and supports English and Thai interface text.

## Development

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Start the dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The page will be available at `http://localhost:5173` by default.

## Adding Languages

Language samples live in `src/samples.js` as an exported object. Add a new key with the language name and a string containing the Hello World code for that language.

This repository is a lightweight demo, not a complete tutorial for every programming language.
